<p><u>Creator / Innovator in Big Data World</u></p>

After graduating from Georgia Tech, I worked for a high frequency trading firm in Chicago. It was more than 10 years ago, and <i>"big data" or "machine learning"</i> was not a thing back then.
However, I was analyzing millions rows of data to find the pattern in the market to create trading strategies. Sound like fun right? :grin: <br><br>  

Spending 5 years in Chicago allowed me to move back to Atlanta for financial model developer in commercial banking industry. I got to involve building pricing models related to interest rates and mortgage rates, and these projects helped me to broaden my understanding in Finance.
It was around 2018 that commercial banks started to invest on building machine learning models with the customer data they've been gathering. I was lucky enough to lead the team to provide consumer insights on wholesale customers. These data were not limited to traditional data such as product purchased data, historical loan transactions.
The new types of data ranging from schools that senior leaders graduated to count of re-tweets on company's news. These new data enabled the view on company's goal more holistically.
<br><br>
World of big data fascinated me, and I've been working as a leader to understand more on consumers since then.

<p><u>Communicator / Intern with lots of curiosity</u></p>

Hi, my name is Sophia Sung. I'm a senior at Johns Creek high school. I know what you would say; why is high school kid doing here? Does she know anything about Finance?
<br><br>
The truth is that time has been changed. If you ask any high school students they either invest in stocks or some coins. Of course, we don't know a lot of theories in Finance, but we took courses in Economics and research on market as hobby.
<br><br>
I was fortunate to spend few months helping create contents for Bi-weekly Market Insight. If a high school student can write and understand what's happening out there, it would be much easy for you to grasp.
<br><br>
Here is few accomplishments I have from Johns Creek high school:
<ul>
    <li>Co-Vice President, Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) in 2022 </li>
    <li>Vice President, UNICEF club</li>
    <li>Amazingly annoying daughter :smirk:</li>
</ul>
