When I say interest rate, I meant federal reserve rate (i.e., fed rate). The fed rate is the base rate of various lending rates offered in banks.
In a very simple way, the burrowing rate from bank should be at least larger than this fed rate. If burrowing rate is increased, it will slow down the inflation and hopefully calm the economy. This is why Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC) meets every month to decide whether to adjust the fed rate.

The figure below is the recent historical fed rate [^1].

[^1]: It is the effective federal funds rate (EFFR). The rate is calculated as a volume-weighted median of overnight federal funds transactions reported in the FR 2420 Report of Selected Money Market Rates

As you can observe from the historical fed rate, it started to hike since March of 2022 when Federal Reserve focused on inflation.
When the interviewer asked about the first 25 basis point (0.25%) interest rate hike, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell quoted as follows:

> as we raise interest rates, that should gradually
slow down demand for the interest-sensitive parts of the economy. And so what we would see is
demand slowing down, but just enough so that it’s better matched with supply. And that
brings—that will bring inflation down over time. That’s our plan.

Also, Powell mentioned that the unemployment is 3.8% in February (lowest since pre-pandemic) and labor market was stronger than expected.

It is important look closely on Powell's expectation and the tone of his speech. The first rate increase in March sounds like it would just slow down the spending and lower inflation while remain strong economy.

Now, let's move to the rate hike announce on June 15, 2022, when Fed raised 75 basis point (i.e., a giant step).
During the announcement and interview, Powell mentioned that Fed policy on inflation is from 'neutral' to 'restrictive' and there will be more rate increase to come to lower the inflation. He also added that the resulting fed rate around 1.25% is still lower than normal condition not to be too worried about.

Here is the market overall reaction with the FOMC announcement [^2]. Market overall reaction is represented by Standard & Poor 500 (S&P500) index. 

[^2]: To make the analysis simple, I used the nominal fed rate on the announcement dates. Therefore, it looks like stepwise function in the plot.

It is important to note that Fed rate increase on announcement date does not directly to relate to either downward or upward of market. 
The start of fed rate hike triggered the overall market to go down. 
Even there was the giant step (75 basis point) on 6/15/2022 FOMC meeting, the market did not go down any further. This can be considered from the market agrees on Federal Research decision and focus on the inflation. 
Market *agreed* that Fed movement was to help the long term strategy to reduce inflation.
However, consecutive rate hikes and unresolved inflation metrics such as CPI index worried the overall market to trending the downward.

What I want to say is fed rate adjustment is one of many monetary policy based on many factors. Russia and Ukraine are still in war and there is energy crisis to make CPI to remain high. Even though labor market was strong, many IT companies started to lay-off and hiring freeze in September onward.
I would safely assume there will be several big step (50 basis point) rate increase in 2023 and if there is no more unexpected situations then it will stable the overall market.
The stable market would indicate we may be coming to the S&P500 market level of 4800 point in later 2023.
