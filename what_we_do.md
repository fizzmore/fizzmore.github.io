<blockquote>How many millionaires do you know who have become wealthy by investing in savings accounts? I rest my case.</blockquote>
<p> The quote above is from Robert G. Allen one of the most influential investment advisors. Well, we understand his point, but this is quite different from what we've learned from our parents, so-called 11th Commandments; <i>you shall <b>save</b></i>.
<p>Our parents saved their incomes into bank deposit because it was considered to be the safest investment.<br>
